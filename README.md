# flutter

This repository includes [Flutter]9https://flutter.dev/) application examples which is a cross-platform application development framework. The specific examples in this repository are:

* __ReviewApp__: Example from [State management for Flutter apps with MobX](https://circleci.com/blog/state-management-for-flutter-apps-with-mobx/) (CircleCI Tutorials)
* __mDNS Browser__: Implements a browser of services on the network through [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)

The applications here are developed on the `v1` branch and currently a configuration is included to use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to build Android APK's when merged into the `master` branch. The APK images can be downloaded as artifacts from CircleCI once built.

## Screenshots

Some screenshots will be added here in due course.
